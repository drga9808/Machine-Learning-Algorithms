# 📘 Machine Learning Algorithms — From Scratch
A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy.
Each algorithm is organized in its own folder and includes:

- 📓 A clear & well‑documented Jupyter Notebook
- 🧠 Full mathematical explanation & formulas
- 🧮 Manual algorithm implementation (no high‑level ML libraries)
- 📊 Visualizations and evaluation metrics
- 📁 A dedicated README for each algorithm
- 🔧 A requirements.txt for reproducibility

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo serves as:
- A learning resource for anyone wanting to understand ML fundamentals
- A demonstration of algorithmic knowledge for recruiters and hiring managers
- A portfolio of clean, well‑written implementations
- A stepping stone toward building more advanced ML systems 📊 Includes Elbow method and Silhouette coefficient for cluster quality evaluation

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented
Below is the list of algorithms included:

### ✔ Soft C-Means (Fuzzy C-Means)
Folder: /Soft-C-Means/
A fully manual implementation including:
- Fuzzy membership updates
- Centroid updates
- Objective function tracking
- Visualizations (cluster plots, silhouette, elbow method)

## ▶️ Running Any Algorithm
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/drga9808/Machine-Learning-Algorithms.git
cd Machine-Learning-Algorithms
```
2. Navigate to the algorithm folder you want:
```
cd Soft-C-Means
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Start Jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook
```
5. Open the notebook and run all cells.

## 🌟 Why This Repo Is Valuable
This repository demonstrates:
- Strong understanding of mathematics behind ML algorithms
- Ability to write clean, modular, well‑commented code
- Skills in data visualization and evaluation
